# Radha
*Krishna's Beloved - Symbol of Pure Devotion*

## Who is Radha?

Radha is Lord Krishna's most beloved companion and represents the highest form of devotion (bhakti). She is the queen of Vrindavan and Krishna's eternal love. Radha shows us how to love God with our whole heart—without asking for anything in return, just pure, selfless love.

## Big Life Beats to Remember

### 1. **The Perfect Devotee**
Radha's love for Krishna was so pure and complete that she became the example for all devotees of how to love God. Her heart had room for nothing but Krishna.

### 2. **The Rasa Lila Dance**
In the divine dance called Rasa Lila, Krishna danced with all the gopis (cowherd girls), but Radha always held the most special place. She represented the soul's perfect union with God.

### 3. **Love Beyond the Physical**
Though Radha and Krishna appeared as lovers, their relationship represents the soul's love for God—pure, eternal, and beyond all worldly attachments.

## Read-Aloud Story: The Heart That Had Room Only for Krishna

*In the beautiful village of Vrindavan, there lived a young girl named Radha whose heart was filled with such love for Krishna that she thought of nothing else day and night.*

*When Krishna played his flute in the evenings, Radha would leave everything—her home, her work, even her food—and run to be with him. The other gopis would ask, "Radha, don't you care about anything else?"*

*"What else is there?" Radha would smile. "When you have found the most beautiful, most loving, most wonderful person in the universe, what else could you possibly want?"*

*During the magical Rasa Lila dance, Krishna would multiply himself so each gopi thought she was dancing only with him. But everyone knew that Radha was Krishna's most beloved because her love was completely selfless.*

*One day, a gopi asked Radha, "What will you do if Krishna ever leaves Vrindavan?"*

*Radha's eyes filled with tears, but she smiled. "My love for Krishna doesn't depend on whether he's near or far. He lives in my heart always. True love doesn't ask for anything—it just loves."*

*When Krishna did leave Vrindavan to fulfill his destiny as a king, Radha never complained. She spent her days telling stories about Krishna to the other gopis, keeping his memory alive with such joy that everyone felt Krishna's presence through her love.*

*What we learn: Radha teaches us that the highest form of love is selfless. When we love God (or anyone) without wanting anything back, that love becomes divine and eternal.*
