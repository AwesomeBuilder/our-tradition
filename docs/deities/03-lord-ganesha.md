# Lord Ganesha
*The Remover of Obstacles*

## Who is Lord Ganesha?

Lord Ganesha is the elephant-headed son of Lord Shiva and Maa Parvati. Known as the "Remover of Obstacles" and "God of Beginnings," he is worshipped first in every prayer, ceremony, and new venture. His big belly represents contentment, his large ears mean good listening, and his small mouth teaches us to speak less and more thoughtfully.

## Big Life Beats to Remember

### 1. **How He Got the Elephant Head**
Parvati created Ganesha from clay to guard her while she bathed. When Shiva returned and was stopped by this unknown boy, he cut off Ganesha's head in anger. To console heartbroken Parvati, Shiva replaced it with an elephant's head and brought him back to life.

### 2. **Why We Pray to Him First**
Shiva declared that Ganesha would be honored first in all ceremonies and prayers. This is why we always start with "Jai Ganesh" before beginning anything new.

### 3. **The Wise Scribe**
Ganesha broke off one of his tusks to use as a pen when writing down the great epic Mahabharata, as dictated by sage Vyasa. This shows his dedication to learning and wisdom.

## Read-Aloud Story: The Boy Who Became Everyone's Favorite

*Once, Maa Parvati wanted to take a peaceful bath. She made a beautiful boy from the paste she used for cleaning (turmeric and clay) and brought him to life. "Guard the door," she told him. "Don't let anyone enter while I'm bathing."*

*The boy stood bravely at the door. When Lord Shiva came home, the boy stopped him. "You cannot enter," he said politely but firmly.*

*"Who is this child who doesn't know me?" thought Shiva, surprised and then angry. In his fury, he cut off the boy's head.*

*When Parvati came out and saw what happened, she was heartbroken. "This was my son!" she cried.*

*Shiva immediately regretted his hasty action. "I will fix this," he promised. He sent his helpers to bring the head of the first creature they found sleeping with its head pointing north. They brought back an elephant's head.*

*Shiva lovingly placed the elephant head on the boy's body and brought him back to life. "You will be called Ganesha," he said, "and everyone will pray to you first before starting anything new. You will remove all obstacles from their path."*

*From that day, Ganesha became everyone's beloved god of new beginnings!*

*What we learn: Even mistakes can be turned into blessings with love and wisdom. Ganesha teaches us that being different makes us special.*
