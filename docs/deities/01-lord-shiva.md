## Big Life Beats to Remember

### 1. **The Blue-Throat Savior (Neelkanth)**
During the churning of the ocean, a deadly poison (halahala) appeared that could destroy all creation. Shiva drank the poison to save everyone, but held it in his throat, turning it blue forever.

### 2. **Daksha's Sacrifice & Sati**
When Sita's father King Daksha insulted Shiva at a grand ceremony, Sita couldn't bear the dishonor and gave up her life. Shiva's grief and righteous fury led to the destruction of the ceremony, but later he forgave and restored peace.

### 3. **Ganesha's Father**
When Parvati created Ganesha to guard her, Shiva unknowingly beheaded him. To console Parvati, Shiva restored Ganesha with an elephant's head, making him the beloved remover of obstacles.

## Read-Aloud Story: The Blue-Throat Hero

*Long, long ago, the gods and demons decided to churn the great ocean to find the nectar of immortality. They used a huge mountain as a churning stick and a giant serpent as rope. As they churned, many wonderful things came out—but then something terrible appeared: a dark, deadly poison that could destroy the whole world!*

*Everyone was terrified. "What do we do?" they cried. Then Lord Shiva stepped forward. "I will drink it," he said calmly. "But I won't let it harm me or anyone else."*

*Shiva drank the poison, but instead of swallowing it, he held it in his throat with his divine power. The poison turned his throat bright blue! From that day, he became known as Neelkanth—the Blue-Throated One.*

*What we learn: Shiva protects everyone, even if it means sacrifice. He shows us that sometimes we must be brave to help others.*
