# Krishna Janmashtami

## Story

Krishna was born at midnight in a prison in Mathura to his parents Devaki and Vasudeva. His uncle, the evil king Kamsa, had locked them up because of a prophecy that Devaki's 8th child would defeat him.

When baby Krishna was born, something magical happened! The prison doors opened by themselves, the guards fell asleep, and his father was able to carry him safely across the flooding Yamuna river to the village of Gokul. There, loving foster parents Yashoda and Nanda raised him.

As a child, Krishna was very playful - he would steal butter, play pranks, and make everyone laugh. But he also performed miracles, like lifting the huge Govardhan mountain to protect people from storms. Krishna grew up to defeat the wicked Kamsa and later gave the world the beautiful teachings of the Bhagavad Gita.
