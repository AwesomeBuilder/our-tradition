# Makar Sankranti

## Story

On this special day, the Sun God (Surya) begins his journey northward in the sky! This means that from now on, the days will get longer and warmer, and the cold winter nights will become shorter.

Unlike other festivals that have big stories with gods and demons, Makar Sankranti is about the Sun's power and the amazing way our Earth moves around the Sun. Our ancestors were very smart - they watched the sky and noticed that on this day, something magical happens: the Sun starts giving us more light each day!

To thank Surya for bringing warmth and light, people take holy baths in rivers, fly colorful kites high in the sky, and share sweet treats made with sesame seeds and jaggery. It's like saying "Welcome back, bright Sun! Thank you for making our world warm and happy!"
