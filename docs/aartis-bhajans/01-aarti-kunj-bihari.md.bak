## Lyrics

**॥ Aarti Kunjabihari Ki, Shri Giridhara Krishna Murari Ki ॥**

Aarti Kunjabihari Ki, Shri Giridhara Krishna Murari Ki।
Gale Mein Baijanti Mala, Bajavai Murali Madhura Bala।
Shravana Mein Kundala Jhalakala, Nanda Ke Ananda Nandalala।
Gagana Sama Anga Kanti Kali, Radhika Chamaka Rahi Ali।
Latana Mein Tharhe Banamali; Bhramara Si Alaka, Kasturi Tilaka,
Chandra Si Jhalaka; Lalita Chhavi Shyama Pyari Ki॥
Shri Giridhara Krishnamurari Ki॥

## Meaning

This beautiful aarti describes Lord Krishna in his divine form and celebrates his pastimes in Vrindavan:

**First Verse:** We perform aarti to Kunjabihari (Krishna who plays in the groves of Vrindavan), the lifter of Govardhan mountain. He wears a garland of basil leaves around his neck and plays the sweet melodious flute. His ears shine with earrings, bringing joy to Nanda (his foster father). His dark complexion shines like the sky, with Radha sparkling beside him. He stands gracefully among the creepers, with hair curled like bees, a tilaka of musk on his forehead, and a face glowing like the moon.

**Second Verse:** His golden peacock feather crown dances beautifully, making even the gods eager for his darshan (divine sight). Flowers rain down from the heavens. The mridanga drums play sweetly along with other instruments, as the cowherd maidens dance with incomparable love and devotion.

**Third Verse:** From where the sacred Ganga manifests, she destroys the darkness of Kali Yuga. Just remembering her brings liberation from delusion. She resides on Lord Shiva's head, flowing through his matted locks, washing away all sins with the beauty of her sacred feet.

**Fourth Verse:** The brilliant shore dust sparkles as the flute of Vrindavan plays. In all directions are gopis, cowherds, and cows. The gentle moonlight smiles softly, cutting through the bonds of worldly existence, listening to the poor devotee's prayers.

The aarti concludes with repeated chanting of praise to Kunjabihari, the lifter of Govardhan hill, Krishna Murari.
