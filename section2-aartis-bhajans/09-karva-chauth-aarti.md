## Lyrics

**Veero karo shravan suno sarag suhagin gave**
वीरो कारो श्रवण सुनो सरग सुहागिन गावे।
*Listen, brave women, the married women in heaven are singing*

**Karva chauth ko vrat hai aaj suhagin rakhave**
करवा चौथ को व्रत है आज सुहागिन रखावे॥
*Today is the Karva Chauth fast that married women observe*

**Sarag mein sundar chand hai, dharti pe suhagin pyari**
सरग मैं सुन्दर चाँद है, धरती पे सुहागिन प्यारी।
*There's a beautiful moon in heaven, dear married women on earth*

**Aap ki kaya chand si, sukh sampati tumhari**
आप की काया चाँद सी, सुख सम्पति तुम्हारी॥
*Your body shines like the moon, happiness and prosperity are yours*

**Aarti utarun main teri, karva chauth ke din**
आरती उतारूं मैं तेरी, करवा चौथ के दिन।
*I offer aarti to you on this Karva Chauth day*

**Tu mujhko suhagin rakhiyo, jabtak suraj chand**
तू मुझको सुहागिन राखियो, जबतक सूरज चांद॥
*Please keep me blessed as a married woman, as long as sun and moon exist*
