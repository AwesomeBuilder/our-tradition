## Core Story
*(For reading aloud)*

Maha Shivaratri is the "Great Night of Shiva" - associated with Shiva and Parvati's divine marriage and Shiva's cosmic dance (Tandava). On this sacred night, devotees offer bel leaves, milk, and chant "Om Namah Shivaya."

Long ago, when the world was in darkness, Lord Shiva performed the Tandava - his cosmic dance of creation, preservation, and destruction. This dance maintains the rhythm of the universe. On this special night, Shiva is closest to his devotees, and even the smallest prayer reaches him directly.

## Symbols & Meanings
*(Kid-friendly)*

- **Lingam abhishek** = Purifying the mind; steady focus like Shiva's meditation
- **Bel leaves** = Three leaves represent the three eyes of Shiva - seeing past, present, and future
- **Night vigil** = Staying awake shows dedication and removes laziness from our hearts
- **Om Namah Shivaya** = "I bow to Shiva" - the most powerful prayer for inner peace

## How We Celebrate at Home

- Offer bel leaves if available
- Light a diya and incense
- Chant "Om Namah Shivaya" together
