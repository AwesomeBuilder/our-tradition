# Dussehra (Vijayadashami)

## Story

Dussehra celebrates two great victories that happened on the same day:

**Rama's Victory:** After 14 years of exile, Lord Rama finally defeated the ten-headed demon king Ravana in Lanka. Ravana had kidnapped Sita, and despite being very learned and powerful, he let his ego and bad desires control him. Rama, with the help of Hanuman and the monkey army, rescued Sita and brought peace to the world.

**Durga's Victory:** On this same day, Goddess Durga defeated the demon Mahishasura after fighting for nine nights. Both victories show that no matter how powerful evil becomes, goodness and dharma will always win.

## The Ten Heads of Ravana

1. **Kama** (Lust)
2. **Krodha** (Anger)
3. **Lobha** (Greed)
4. **Moha** (Attachment)
5. **Mada** (Pride)
6. **Matsarya** (Jealousy)
7. **Swartha** (Selfishness)
8. **Anyaya** (Injustice)
9. **Amanavata** (Cruelty)
10. **Ahankara** (Ego)
