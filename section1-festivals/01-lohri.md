# Lohri

## Story

Long ago in Punjab, there lived a brave folk hero named Dulha Bhatti who helped poor people during difficult times. People would sing songs about his good deeds around bonfires to remember his kindness.

But the real story of Lohri is about thanking Fire (Agni) and the Sun (Surya) for keeping us warm through the cold winter. On this day, we celebrate because the longest nights are ending, and slowly the days will start getting warmer and brighter!

We gather around a big bonfire and throw offerings like sesame seeds, jaggery, and popcorn into the fire. This is our way of saying "Thank you, Fire! Thank you, Sun! Please keep giving us warmth and light!"

## Symbols & Meanings

- **Sesame seeds (til) & jaggery** = Sweet blessings and sticking together like family
