## Core Story
*(For reading aloud)*

Diwali is the most joyful festival of lights! It celebrates the day when Lord Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana returned home to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile and after defeating the demon king Ravana.

The people of Ayodhya were so happy to see their beloved prince come home! They lit thousands of oil lamps (diyas) to welcome them. The whole city sparkled with lights - that's why we call it "Deepavali" which means "row of lights."

In some places, people also celebrate Krishna's victory over the demon Narakasura on this day. Both stories teach us the same beautiful lesson: light always defeats darkness, and good always wins over evil!

## The Five Days of Diwali

1. **Dhanteras** - Welcome health and wealth
2. **Naraka Chaturdashi** - Victory over evil (some regions)
3. **Diwali** - Main celebration with Lakshmi puja
4. **Govardhan Puja** - Krishna lifts the mountain
