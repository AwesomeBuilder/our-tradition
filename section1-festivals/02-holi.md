# Holi

## Story

Holi has two beautiful stories:

**The Story of Prahlad:** Young prince Prahlad loved Lord Vishnu, but his father, the demon king Hiranyakashipu, forbade it. To punish Prahlad, the king's sister Holika (who couldn't be burned) sat with Prahlad in a fire. But Prahlad's prayers saved him, and Holika burned instead! This is why we light the Holika bonfire - to burn away all that is evil.

**Krishna's Colors:** In Vrindavan, young Krishna was sad because his skin was dark while Radha's was fair. His mother Yashoda playfully suggested he color Radha's face any color he wanted! Krishna and his friends started playing with colors, and soon everyone in the village was laughing and playing together. All differences disappeared in the rainbow of colors!

## Symbols & Meanings

- **Holika fire** = Burning away bad habits and negative thoughts
- **Colors** = Joy, friendship, and equality - everyone looks the same covered in colors!
- **Spring celebration** = New life, fresh starts, and happiness
- **Playing together** = Breaking barriers and making friends

## How We Celebrate at Home

- Light a small bonfire (or candle) the night before
- Play with safe, natural colors (organic gulal)
- Prepare festive sweets like gujiya
- Sing Holi songs and dance
- Forgive old grudges and start fresh
- Share colors with neighbors and friends
