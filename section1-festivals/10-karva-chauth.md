# Karva Chauth

## Story

Long ago, there lived a devoted wife who loved her husband very much. She decided to fast for his long life and well-being. She didn't eat or drink anything the whole day and waited for the moon to rise in the evening.

The story of Karva Chauth comes from the love between Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. Parvati would fast and pray for Shiva's well-being, showing how much she cared for him. When we celebrate Karva Chauth, we remember this beautiful example of devotion and care in a marriage.

The festival teaches us that in a family, we care for each other and pray for each other's happiness and long life.

## The Beautiful Ritual

1. **Morning** - Sargi (pre-dawn meal) with mother-in-law's blessings
2. **Day** - Fasting without food or water
3. **Evening** - Dressing in beautiful clothes and jewelry
4. **Sunset** - Stories and prayers with other women
5. **Moonrise** - Looking at moon through sieve, then at husband
6. **Breaking fast** - Husband offers first sip of water
