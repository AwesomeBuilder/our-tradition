## Core Story
*(For reading aloud)*

After Diwali comes a beautiful story about young Krishna and his love for nature and people!

In the village of Vrindavan, people used to worship Indra, the king of gods, for rain and good weather. But little Krishna had a different idea. "Why should we worship someone far away?" he asked. "Let's thank the Govardhan Hill that gives us grass for our cows, water from its streams, and shelter from storms!"

The villagers agreed and stopped their prayers to Indra. This made Indra very angry! He sent terrible storms and floods to punish the village.

But Krishna had a plan. He lifted the entire Govardhan Hill like an umbrella and held it up for seven days and nights! All the people and animals stayed safe and dry underneath. Finally, Indra realized his mistake and stopped the storm.

This teaches us to take care of nature and not be proud or bossy with others.
