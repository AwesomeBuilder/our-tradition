# Sharad Navratri

## Story

This is the most important Navratri of the year! Just like in Chaitra Navratri, we celebrate Maa Durga's victory over the demon Mahishasura. But this time, it's during the autumn season when nature is preparing for winter.

The story is the same beautiful tale: the powerful demon Mahishasura was troubling everyone. All the gods came together and created Goddess Durga with their combined powers. She fought the demon for nine nights, and on the tenth day (Dussehra), she won!

In many places, people also celebrate this as the time when Lord Rama worshipped Durga for nine days to get strength to defeat Ravana. So both stories - Durga's victory and Rama's victory - are celebrated together.

### The Nine Days & Colors

Each day has a special color to wear:

1. **Day 1** - Royal Blue (Shailaputri)
2. **Day 2** - Yellow (Brahmacharini)
3. **Day 3** - Green (Chandraghanta)
4. **Day 4** - Grey (Kushmanda)
5. **Day 5** - Orange (Skandamata)
6. **Day 6** - White (Katyayani)
7. **Day 7** - Red (Kalaratri)
8. **Day 8** - Sky Blue (Mahagauri)
9. **Day 9** - Pink (Siddhidatri)
