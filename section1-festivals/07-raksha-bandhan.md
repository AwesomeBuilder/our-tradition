# Raksha Bandhan

## Story

**Krishna and Draupadi:** Once, Lord Krishna hurt his finger and it started bleeding. His friend Draupadi quickly tore a piece of her sari and tied it around his finger to stop the bleeding. Krishna was so touched by her caring that he promised, "I will always protect you like a brother."

Years later, when Draupadi was in great trouble in the royal court, Krishna kept his promise. He saved her honor by making her sari endless. This shows how a small act of love can create a lifelong bond of protection.

**Indra and Indrani:** In heaven, the king of gods, Indra, was losing a great battle. His wife Indrani tied a sacred thread around his wrist and prayed for his victory. With this blessing, Indra won the war. This was one of the first rakhi threads!
