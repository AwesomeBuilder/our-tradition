# Ram Navami

## Story

On this day, Lord Rama was born in Ayodhya to King Dasharatha and Queen Kausalya. Rama grew up to be the perfect son, brother, and king. His life teaches us about dharma (doing the right thing), courage, and love for family.

Rama was known as "Maryada Purushottam" - the ideal man who always followed rules and was kind to everyone. He loved his wife Sita deeply, cared for his brothers, respected his parents, and was fair to all people in his kingdom. Even when he had to go to the forest for 14 years, he never complained. His devotee Hanuman showed us what true friendship and service mean.

The most important lesson from Rama's life is that we should always choose what is right, even when it's difficult.
