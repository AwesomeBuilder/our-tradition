## Core Story
*(For reading aloud)*

Long, long ago, the gods and demons decided to churn the great ocean to find the nectar of immortality (amrita). As they churned the ocean with a huge mountain and a serpent, many wonderful things came out of the water.

One of the most important was **Dhanvantari**, the divine doctor, who emerged carrying a pot of amrita. He became the god of health and medicine. On Dhanteras, we remember him and pray for good health for our family.

Also from the ocean came **Goddess Lakshmi**, sitting on a lotus flower, bringing prosperity and wealth. We pray to her for abundance - not just money, but abundance of love, happiness, and good things in life.
