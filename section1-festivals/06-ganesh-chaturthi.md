## Core Story
*(For reading aloud)*

Once, Goddess Parvati wanted to take a bath. She made a beautiful boy from the paste she used for cleaning (turmeric and sandalwood) and gave him life. "Guard the door," she told him. "Don't let anyone in."

When Lord Shiva came home, the boy stopped him! "You cannot enter," he said bravely. Shiva was surprised - who was this boy who didn't know him? In anger, Shiva cut off the boy's head.

When Parvati came out and saw what happened, she was very sad. "This was my son!" she cried. Shiva felt terrible. "I will fix this," he promised. He sent his helpers to bring the head of the first animal they found. They brought back an elephant's head.

Shiva placed the elephant head on the boy and brought him back to life. "You will be Ganesha," he said, "and everyone will pray to you first before starting anything new. You will remove all obstacles!"
