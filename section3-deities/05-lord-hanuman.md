## Big Life Beats to Remember

### 1. **Finding Sita in Lanka**
When Sita was kidnapped by Ravana, Hanuman leaped across the ocean to Lanka, found her in the Ashoka garden, gave her Rama's ring as proof, and assured her that rescue was coming.

### 2. **The Sanjeevani Mountain**
When Lakshmana was mortally wounded in battle, Hanuman flew to the Himalayas to fetch a healing herb. Unable to identify the right plant, he carried the entire mountain back so healers could find what they needed.

### 3. **Burning Lanka with His Tail**
When Ravana's soldiers set Hanuman's tail on fire, he used it as an opportunity to burn down parts of Lanka, showing that even attempts to harm a devotee can backfire on evil.

## Read-Aloud Story: When in Doubt, Lift the Mountain!

*During the great war in Lanka, something terrible happened. Rama's beloved brother Lakshmana was struck by a magical weapon and fell unconscious. The army physician said, "Only the Sanjeevani herb from the Himalayas can save him, but it must be brought before sunrise, or he will die!"*

*All eyes turned to Hanuman. "I'll bring it!" he declared and immediately flew toward the distant mountains.*

*When Hanuman reached the mountain, he searched everywhere for the Sanjeevani herb. But there were so many plants! Which one was the right one? Time was running out, and the sun would rise soon.*

*Then Hanuman had a brilliant idea. "If I can't find the right plant, I'll make sure I have the right plant!" He dug his mighty hands around the entire mountain, lifted it up, and flew back to Lanka carrying the whole mountain on his palm!*

*The physician quickly found the Sanjeevani herb and healed Lakshmana. Everyone cheered! Rama hugged Hanuman and said, "Your devotion and quick thinking saved my brother's life."*

*What we learn: When we act with pure love and determination, we find a way to help others, even if it means doing something that seems impossible.*
