## Big Life Beats to Remember

### 1. **Born from the Ocean**
During the great churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthan), Goddess Lakshmi rose from the waters sitting on a beautiful lotus flower. She chose Lord Vishnu as her husband, and they became the divine couple of preservation and prosperity.

### 2. **The Wandering Goddess**
Lakshmi is known to move from house to house, blessing those who keep their homes clean, work honestly, and share generously with others. She leaves places where there is greed, laziness, or selfishness.

### 3. **Four Forms of Wealth**
Lakshmi gives four types of prosperity: Dhana (money), Dhanya (food grains), Gaja (royal power), and Ashwarya (all kinds of abundance). She wants us to use all of these to help others.

## Read-Aloud Story: The Goddess Who Chose Love

*Long ago, the gods and demons decided to churn the great ocean to find the nectar of immortality. They used Mount Mandara as a churning rod and the great serpent Vasuki as a rope.*

*As they churned, many wonderful and terrible things came out of the ocean—deadly poison, the moon, a divine horse, and precious gems. Then, something magical happened.*

*Rising from the white foam of the ocean came the most beautiful goddess anyone had ever seen. She sat gracefully on a pink lotus flower, wearing golden silk clothes and jewels that sparkled like stars. Four white elephants showered her with pure water.*

*"Who is this divine being?" everyone wondered.*

*"I am Lakshmi," she said with a gentle smile, "and I bring prosperity, good fortune, and abundance wherever I go."*

*All the gods and demons wanted to marry her. But Lakshmi looked around and saw Lord Vishnu standing calmly with a kind, loving expression. She placed a beautiful garland around his neck.*

*"I choose Vishnu," she said, "because he protects and preserves all good things in the universe. Together, we will take care of everyone."*

*From that day, wherever Vishnu went to help people, Lakshmi went too—bringing prosperity to those who lived with dharma (righteousness).*

*What we learn: True wealth goes to those who are kind, honest, and caring. Lakshmi chooses hearts that are generous and loving.*
