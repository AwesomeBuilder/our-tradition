## Read-Aloud Story: The Prince Who Chose Duty

*Once upon a time in the beautiful kingdom of Ayodhya, there lived a prince named Rama who was loved by everyone. He was kind, brave, truthful, and always helped others. His father, King Dasharatha, was ready to make him king.*

*But the night before the coronation, Rama's stepmother remembered an old promise the king had made to her. "Send Rama to the forest for 14 years," she demanded. The king was heartbroken, but he had given his word.*

*When Rama heard this, he didn't get angry or fight. "A promise is a promise," he said. "I will go to the forest." His wife Sita and brother Lakshmana insisted on going with him.*

*For 14 years, they lived simply in the forest. When the demon king Ravana kidnapped Sita, Rama didn't give up. With the help of Hanuman and the monkey army, he fought bravely and brought her back safely.*

*When they returned to Ayodhya, the people lit thousands of lamps to welcome their beloved prince home. Rama became king and ruled with such justice and kindness that everyone was happy.*

*What we learn: Rama teaches us that keeping our word, doing our duty, and treating everyone fairly are more important than power or comfort.*
