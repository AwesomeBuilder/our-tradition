## Read-Aloud Story: The Baby Who Crossed the Storm

*Long ago, in the city of Mathura, lived an evil king named Kamsa who was afraid of a prophecy: his sister Devaki's eighth child would defeat him. So he locked up Devaki and her husband Vasudeva in prison.*

*When baby Krishna was born at midnight, something magical happened! The prison guards fell asleep, the chains fell away, and the doors opened by themselves. Vasudeva put baby Krishna in a basket and stepped out into the stormy night.*

*The river Yamuna was flooding, but as Vasudeva carried Krishna across, the waters parted! The great serpent Shesha appeared and spread his hood over the baby to keep him dry from the rain.*

*Safely across the river, Vasudeva reached the village of Gokul, where the kind cowherd Nanda and his wife Yashoda became Krishna's loving foster parents. They raised him with so much love that Krishna's childhood in Vrindavan became the happiest time ever!*

*Little Krishna would sneak into neighbors' houses to steal butter, play with his friends, and make everyone laugh with his mischief. But he also performed miracles—like when he lifted the huge Govardhan mountain to shelter everyone from a terrible storm.*

*What we learn: God protects innocence and comes to those who love purely. Krishna shows us that joy, love, and playfulness are also divine.*

## Read-Aloud Story: Krishna and His Best Friend Sudama

*Krishna had a childhood friend named Sudama who was very poor. Years later, when Sudama's family had no food, his wife urged him to visit Krishna (who had become a king) and ask for help.*

*Sudama was embarrassed but took only a small handful of beaten rice as a gift. When he reached Krishna's palace, the guards wanted to stop this poorly dressed man. But Krishna saw him and ran out with joy!*

*"My dear friend!" Krishna hugged him, washed his feet, and treated him like the most honored guest. Krishna ate the simple beaten rice with such love, as if it were the finest feast.*

*Sudama felt so loved that he couldn't bring himself to ask for help. When he returned home, he found his humble hut had been transformed into a beautiful home, and his family had everything they needed.*

*What we learn: Krishna values love and friendship more than riches. True friends help each other without being asked.*
