## Read-Aloud Story: The Patient Love That Moved a Mountain

*After Sati left her body due to her father's insults to Shiva, the heartbroken Shiva went deep into meditation in the Himalayas. He sat so still for so long that snow covered him, and he seemed like a statue.*

*Meanwhile, the Divine Mother was reborn as Parvati, the beautiful daughter of the Himalaya king Himavan. As she grew up, her heart was filled with love for Shiva, though she had never seen him.*

*One day, she discovered Shiva meditating on her father's mountain. "This is the one my heart has been calling to," she thought.*

*Parvati began serving Shiva daily—bringing flowers, cleaning around his meditation spot, and sitting nearby in respectful silence. But Shiva was so deep in meditation that he didn't notice her.*

*Then Parvati decided to do serious tapas herself. She went into the forest, gave up all comforts, ate only fruits, then only leaves, then nothing at all. She meditated through hot summers and cold winters, never giving up.*

*Shiva, impressed by her devotion, decided to test her. He disguised himself as a young man and approached her.*

*"Why are you doing such difficult practices?" he asked. "That Shiva you're trying to please is just a wandering yogi with no home, no wealth, and snakes for jewelry. You could marry a proper king instead!"*

*Parvati's eyes flashed with love and determination. "Don't speak badly of Shiva! He is the most wonderful being in the universe. I will marry only him, no matter how long it takes!"*

*Shiva was moved by her pure devotion. He revealed his true form, and they were married in the most beautiful wedding ever, attended by all the gods.*

*What we learn: True love combined with patient effort can achieve anything. Parvati teaches us never to give up on what our hearts know is right.*
